The sequence of Chando is an infinite sequence of all Chando's numbers in an ascending order.

A number is called Chando's if it is an integer that can be represented as a sum of different positive integer powers of 5.

The first Chando's numbers are 5, 25, 30, 125, 130, 150...  

Your task is to find the Chando's N-th number for a given N. 

Input (N) → integer :

1 <= N <= 7000
Output → integer :

N-th Chando's number
